Welcome to my dotfiles. Here's a summary:

## Xmonad + Xmobar

I use [xmonad](https://xmonad.org/) as a WM with the [xmobar](https://github.com/jaor/xmobar) bar. My configs includes a system tray to.
There's also a polybar config, but I don't remember if it works.

## Neovim

I use a neat ftplugin config for Markdown that adds a bunch of keymaps for math mode, very useful for writing assignments. There are two versions:
a vimscript one and a Lua one. In the future I want to migrate all my neovim configs to Lua! Also includes a Evangelion colorscheme. 

## Vifm

I have a beautiful [vifm](https://vifm.info/) config, including [icons and image preview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnMXH_K8hz4).

## Alacritty

Alacritty with a Neon Genesis Evangelion colorscheme.
